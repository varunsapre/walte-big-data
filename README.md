# What America Likes to Eat
This project aims to `visualise popular food across major metropolitan areas in the US`. It aims to help travelers, visitors, immigrants and even locals view the local interest in food and its popularity. 

To achieve this, we have used the public dataset from `Yelp` along with opinions on the restaurants from `Twitter`. Using `FLAIR sentiment analysis` we found the overall sentiment for the restaurants and used it in `ranking algorithm` to determine the most popular food type of the stated area. 

The result was then loaded into `ArcGIS` allowing the users to select the desired area to view the most popular food and give insights to Americaâ€™s food habits.
